# HumanWrites/WebComponents

## What is it?

This package is a set of two web components TextWriter and CodeWriter which imitate the human writing style on a keyboard.

### Features

TextWriter writes raw and HTML text, when an HTML tag is found the style of this tag is applied to the text.

CodeWriter writes HTML text inside a _pre_ tag embedding a _code_ tag for the decoration. When a tag is found it is written as is and not interpreted.

CodeWriter supports code highlighting thanks to HighlightJS library integration. All resources of the HighlightJS library are requested inside the webcomponent, so you do not have to worry about them.

The writing speed depends on the delay between two charaters plus the process time to determine the character to display. The delay is 60 milliseconds by default.

Both components also propose to:
- make mistakes :angry:
- correct mistakes right away :smile:
- chain each other with the parameter _depends-on-selector_, eg: with 2 components if the second references the first it starts when the first finishes.
- write at random speed. The speed is computed from 25% faster to 75% slower than the given speed parameter.  

## Live demo

Go to https://human-writes.io/ to see how they work. Look at the page source to see the implementations.

## Installation

### As a script in a page

You can also find the script here https://www.human-writes.io/js/human-writes/latest/human-writes.min.js.

Add this line in the head section of your page:

```html
<script src="https://www.human-writes.io/js/human-writes/latest/human-writes.min.js"></script>
```

### As a module

These components are designed for use with browser only. However, if you have a NodeJS based project you can get the module:

```bash
npm i human-writes
```

or 

```bash
yarn add human-writes
```

The module is built with webpack so you can find the actual script in _node_modules/human-writes/dist/human-writes.min.js_.


## Use cases

### TextWriter

You have a text block to describe the features of a project, to promote a product or to introduce a longer text. TextWriter can help you to catch the attention of the visitor on this part of your site.

#### Implementation

Store your text block in a place accessible by URL and declare it as a source of the webcomponent.

```html
<text-writer
    name="hello"
    source="/my-block-of-text.html" 
    speed="20"
    make-mistakes="true" 
    styles="/css/index.css,/css/app.css" 
    classes="App-content" 
>
</text-writer>

```

### CodeWriter

You have an IT oriented technical documentation, and you want to share code snippets. This is a quite common use-case nowadays.

CodeWriter does the same job as TextWriter except it follows code syntax workflow by opening and closing brackets before it writes code in between.

#### Implementation

Store your block of code in a place accessible by URL and declare it as a source of the webcomponent.

```html
<code-writer 
    depends-on-selector="text-writer[name='hello']"
    source="/my-block-of-code.html"
    use-highlight-js="true"
    theme="base16/monokai"
    language="php"
>
</code-writer>
```

The use of HighlightJS library is disabled by default so you must declare it to _true_ to use it. Once enabled, you can pass the _theme_ and the _language_ as parameters. Default values are respectively **"base16/monokai"** and **"html"**. Find more themes and languages on https://highlightjs.org.
